The first study considered was "Breast Cancer Prediction: A Comparative Study Using Machine
Learning Techniques", Islam. The paper compares 5 different supervised machine learning techniques (SVM, KNN, random forests, ANN, and logistic regression.) They divided the data into test and train sets, and used a 10-fold cross validation, with nine-fold used for training and the remaining fold used for testing. The results revealed that ANNs return the highest accuracy ($98.57%$), KNN and SVM came second ($97.1%$). ANNs also achieved the highest specificity ($96%$). The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset was used.

A similar study, "Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Risk
Prediction and Diagnosis", Asri. tested SVM, decision tree, Naive Bayes, as well as KNN on the same dataset. Asri et al. discovered that although SVM took the longest time to create a model, it resulted in the highest accuracy. I do not believe that time constraints will be important in regards to our model. For this reason, we decided to use SVM for our model.
